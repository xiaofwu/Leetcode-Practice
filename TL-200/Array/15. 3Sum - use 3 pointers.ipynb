    "Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that \n",

    "1) most intuitive way: use double for loop to setup a dictionary {{i, j}: nums[i]+nums[j]}\n",
    "2) for any nums[k], if nums[k] + dict[{i,j}] =0, and k not in {i, j}, then \n",

    "3） problem is how to deal with duplicate triplicate. I tried to use set() to convert all small lists in\n",

    "    --- > very hard to implement because \" All built-in immutable objects, like tuples, are hashable while \n",
    "    mutable containers like lists and dictionaries are not hashable\". That means list is not hashable, while\n",

    "Solution from Youtube:\n",
    "This is the solution based on Two Sum and Two Sum II, plus idea of using 3 pointers. This is a very good solution!!!\n",
    "idea is as the following:\n",
    "1) First, we need to sort the list in order to use two pointers to move in both directions.\n",
    "2) Let's start from nums[0] (current pointer), then we set left pointer to nums[1], and right pointer to nums[len-1].\n",
    "    Next we start to move two pointers toward each other. Every stop, we calculate sum = current+left+right. if sum=0,\n",
    "    we append a list of three elements pointed to a rList. Keep moving while left < right.\n",
    "3) How to deal with duplicate triplicate:\n",
    "    a) when we move current pointers, we skip it and moves on if the next element has the same value. \n",
    "    b) we also need to do the same thing when we move left and right pointers. Every time we meet the same value, \n",
    "        we skip it and move pointer one more step.\n",
