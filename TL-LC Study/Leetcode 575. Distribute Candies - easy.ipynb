    "Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, \n",
    "so she visited a doctor. The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). \n",

    "1) if there are more than n/2 types of candies. Then she can eat at most n/2 types\n",
